<h1>The Best Movies According to Melissa</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<h3>Harry Potter Series</h3>

<p>This is simply one of the best movie renditions of one of my favorite book series. Most movies depicting books are not as good as the book but I thought they did well with these event though plenty was still different or left out of the movie completely.</p>

<h3>Easy A</h3>

<p>This would likely not be on many people's top 3 favorites, but it is a familiar favorite for me and one that I can just watch if I need to unwind or destress. Plus, Emma Stone is a favorite of actress of mine.

<p>Artistically this is one of my all time favorites to watch simply because it is such a beautiful world that was created and this is a movie that really wanted to showcase some awesome graphics. Visually it is stunning. </p>
